# Yiedie backend

## Render deployment

Use `npm ci` as the build command, `npm start` as the start command, and
`/api/health` as the health check path. The server uses Render's `PORT`.

Set these variables in the Render service's **Environment** settings:

```dotenv
NODE_ENV=production
HOST=0.0.0.0
CLIENT_ORIGINS=https://pro-yiedie.vercel.app
COOKIE_SAME_SITE=none
TRUST_PROXY=1
```

Keep your `DATABASE_URL` and `SESSION_SECRET` configured as secrets. Save the
environment changes and redeploy the backend with the latest code.

`CLIENT_ORIGINS` contains frontend origins, without paths or trailing slashes.
For multiple frontends, use a comma-separated list of their exact origins.
An environment value replaces the default list in `src/config.js`; copying the
local `.env` to Render would allow only localhost and retain development cookie
settings. Set the production values above explicitly.

On Render, `TRUST_PROXY` defaults to `1` so secure cookies work behind its HTTPS
proxy. An explicit value such as `TRUST_PROXY=0` overrides that default.
`COOKIE_SAME_SITE=none` requires `NODE_ENV=production` and HTTPS.

In the Vercel frontend project's environment settings, set:

```dotenv
VITE_API_URL=https://yeidie-backend.onrender.com/api
```

Redeploy the frontend after changing this value. The frontend already includes
credentials on API requests and sends `X-CSRF-Token` for mutations.

### Verify CORS

```sh
curl -i -X OPTIONS 'https://yeidie-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/login' \
  -H 'Origin: https://pro-yiedie.vercel.app' \
  -H 'Access-Control-Request-Method: POST' \
  -H 'Access-Control-Request-Headers: content-type,x-csrf-token'
```

Expect HTTP `204`, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://pro-yiedie.vercel.app`,
`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`, and the requested headers in
`Access-Control-Allow-Headers`.

`GET /api/auth/csrf` over HTTPS should return a session cookie with `Secure`,
`HttpOnly`, and `SameSite=None`. If CORS succeeds but login returns
`CSRF_INVALID`, check that the browser stores and sends this cookie. Browser
settings that block third-party cookies can prevent sessions between the
Vercel and Render domains; using frontend and API custom domains under the same
site avoids that cross-site dependency.

If the service returns `502` or `503`, check Render's startup and database logs.
Those responses can appear as browser CORS errors when the application never
gets a chance to add its headers.

## Checks

```sh
npm run check
npm test
```
